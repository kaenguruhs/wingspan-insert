# Wingspan - Flügelschlag - Insert incl. Oceania and Europe expansions
Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5253526

This is my insert for wingspan (german Flügelschlag). The goal was to have an insert for the base game and both expansions, europe and oceania AND to keep the original dice tower as well as all player boards in the box.

With this insert it is possible to store the box on its side without the boxes shifting around too much.

Please have a look at the photos to see how the prints go in the box.

The insert was created with openSCAD and you can download and customize the source files from github: https://github.com/kaenguruhs/wingspan-insert

I printed it with a .6-nozzle and a layer height of .48mm - just to be as fast as possible. You have to print:
1x automa.stl (for automa-cards, obviously)
1x bonus.stl (for the bonus-cards, goes on top of automa-cards)
1x eier.stl (for all the eggs)
1x bonus-wuerfel.stl (for the 5 dices from the base-game, the other 5 dices from the oceania expansion and the bonus tiles)
1x nektar.stl (for the nectar-ressources from oceania-expansion)
1x ressourcen.stl (for all ressources)
1x spielerwuerfel.stl (for the player cubes)
4x vogel-x4.stl (for all of the bird cards from the base game, the europe and the oceania expansion)
